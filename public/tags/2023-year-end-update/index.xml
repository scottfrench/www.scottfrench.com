      <description>In October I lost the thread on my guitar projects. In September school really starts getting going for my kids. In early October we have my son&#39;s birthday, then my wife&#39;s birthday. Then a family camping trip, then Halloween, Thanksgiving, colder weather, and a big, slow, frustrating project at work. Then weeks of holiday prep, family Christmas, and finally the New Year. I lost the thread! It&#39;s happened around late fall many times in past years, but it was a especially frustrating this time because in 2023 I had been making very stead progress.</description>
