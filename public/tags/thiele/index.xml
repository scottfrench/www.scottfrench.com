      <description>This is the Holy Grail of Mesa cabs, a vintage hardwood &amp; wicker Thiele with Electro-Voice EVM-12L from 1987. When you consider this thing is over 30 years old it is in pretty nice shape. It was made using amazing 13&#34; wide imbuia boards. Condition is pretty nice overall. There are dents and dings throughout, but overall it presents pretty well. Weight is 48lbs. I&#39;ve purchased this cab twice and both times it was poorly packaged.</description>

      <description>This is the Holy Grail of Mesa cabs, a vintage hardwood &amp; wicker Thiele with EVM-12L from the Mark III era. When you consider this thing is around 30 years old it is in pretty nice shape. It was made using amazing 13&#34; wide imbuia boards. Condition is pretty nice overall. There are dents and dings throughout, and also some substantial scratches on top from amp feet. The speaker and it has a 1989 date code.</description>
