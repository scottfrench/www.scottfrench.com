      <title>SF3co Eco Guitar Prototype</title>

      <description>I started this prototype and the potential line of instruments it represented after taking a break from lutherie. It marked a shift in how I think about guitars and how I go about working on a project. Even though it was ultimately not a success, I did learn a lot about doing things I actually care about. The response to this instrument from potential customers was very strong and the fact that I didn&#39;t build a ton of them for excited customers really has more to do with my own personal situation starting a family and nothing to do with players&#39; appetite for &#39;alternative&#39; instruments.</description>

      <title>Redwood SF2 Chambered Guitar</title>

      <description>I could write a lot about this guitar, but ultimately I&#39;ll just say that trying to finish the burl redwood I used for the top
had me questioning my choice to ever get involved with guitar building. In the end, finish problems aside this guitar ended
up being pretty cool and sounding really good. The SF2 is a scaled down acoustic guitar design, but really it is too
traditional for me at this point and I doubt I will go any further down this path.</description>

      <title>Buckeye Burl SF3 Singlecut Guitar</title>

      <description>My friend Ian called one day and let me know our local Salvation Army had an absolute unit of a buckeye burl table come in that week.
I dropped everything to go look and it ended up being several burls combined into one table using about 40 pounds of epoxy and fiberglass.
We ruined a chainsaw blade and bandsaw blade just getting this one blank out of the table, but it was well worth it.</description>

      <title>Pink Paisley SF3 Leo Fender Tribute Guitar</title>

      <description>I built this guitar as a tribute to Leo Fender. Like every gutiar builder ever I love his material choices, simple solutions,
and timeless designs. I didn&#39;t want to lean all the way into the vintage trap though so I included some crazy 18v active
pickups. If I built this one again I would do an oiled &amp;amp; waxed bolt-on neck.</description>

      <title>Redwood &amp; Maple SF3 Bowable Guitar</title>

      <description>This SF3 came with a fairly straightforward goal: to be easy to play with a bow.
Narrowing the SF3 design and doing an exagerated top carve ended up being the easy part...
findings pickups and a bridge to accomodate that extreme radius was more challenging.
Nordstrand was able to supply some custom NDC humbuckers with super staggered magnets for the pickups.
For the bridge I used Graphtech saddles and built a very custom ebony bridge by hand.</description>

      <description>This is another fun SF3 with further refinements of the bodyshape. I found the one-piece top on a road trip in the Pacific Northwest. Lots of nice bloodwood details on this one that pair really well with the myrtle. </description>

      <description>There was a time when it was very hard to find to find wenge locally so I generally grabbed
it whenever it did show up. With that spirit one day I visited my most local, small town lumber
store and found some HUGE wenge slabs with plenty of space for multiple one-piece tops. I bought
all the clean boards and have been using them ever since. For me this guitar really was all</description>

      <description>I don&#39;t generally aim for using woods that compeltely steal the show, but even with subdued blanks I feel
like that&#39;s what ended up happening here. This black limba top and rosewood neck combo just really popped and
everything came together nicely. This is a great build to highlight how material selection and more importantly
a creative cut list can really impact the outcome. My memory is this was was originally a one-piece flat-sawn</description>

      <description>This SF3 represents a big transition with the design of the headstock and heel being refinfed
quite a bit. It was also a really light one thanks to the chambered redwood body and myrtle top. 
The redwood came from a thrift shop table and the myrtle from a Pacific Northwest road trip.</description>

      <title>Headless SF3 Singlecut Synth Guitar</title>

      <description>This was a fun project with a lot of elements I had never worked with before. The active pickups and Roland synth setup were interesting and the headless hardware worked out well. This did inspire me to want to work on a more elegant headless setup as the hardware was a bit industrial in design and feel. All the black parts and the heavy headless hardware definitely gave this one a unique feel within my body of work.</description>

      <description>This guitar came about when I lucked into two really nice pieces of local wood. This was
easily the best billet of figured red gum eucalyptus I&#39;ve ever ran into, and the grafted walnut
billet was really nice too. I came up with a plan to make a very thin guitar using these woods.
The inside is hollow and the edges ended up very thin. Even with very heavy solid brass bridge,</description>

      <description>This was an instrument with a lot of experimental elements. One of the first polyester finishes, first time
mixing body wood, first time using magnets with the control cover, and first experience with the SD Invaders!
Many firsts, but few things I even returned to.</description>

      <description>This is a project that evolved a lot from start to finish, but one goal all along was to make a very light
guitar. This one-piece swamp ash body was light to start, but I had the face sliced off so we could
do some chambering and make it even lighter.</description>

      <description>It&#39;s an amazing thing when you get your first real customer. Working at the First Act Studio for Artists I had already worked on a good amount
of instruments for big names, and I was lucky enough to have some awesome musicians as friends that I had built for, but this was my first
real customer. We exchanged a few emails about the specs then one day a check showed up and I started building.</description>

      <description>Spencer and I started talking about this guitar while I was still in Boston working at First Act.
We were hoping to get something going with their Studio for Artists program but it never panned out.
There&#39;s obviously a lot going on here... I think we hit some of the bullet points pretty well and others
lagged behind a bit. I know the stereo panning ability made it in to an album or two which is always</description>
