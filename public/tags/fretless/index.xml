      <description>As I mentioned on the Inspiration page of this site, Atlansia has been one of my favorite builders for a long time. These instruments so rarely show up in the US that I didn&#39;t think long when I saw this one pop up for sale in Japan with US shipping as an option. Even with slow COVID shipping from Japan it was still worth it. I ordered it mostly to check out all the interesting features so I will likely move it along somewhat soon.</description>
