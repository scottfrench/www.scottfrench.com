      <description>The May and June Update ended up being so big that there wasn&#39;t much room left, but being that we&#39;re half way through 2023 I wanted to reflect a bit on the year so far. Just a little background, at the very start of 2022 I made the decision to really focus on getting back into luthiery. I had been playing with it since around 2018, but a lot of competing ideas meant there wasn&#39;t much forward progress.</description>

      <description>This journal was intended to be updated monthly, but here we are with back-to-back entries spanning two full months each. I should be back on the monthly schedule going forward. One more note before moving into the actual update... I had planned on attending the 2023 GAL Convention this upcoming week, but when I starting really looking at my current progress and funds, I decided it would be better to spend that time and money working on an actual guitar instead of going on a trip.</description>
