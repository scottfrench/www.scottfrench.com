      <description>I had a fun day down at Kauer Guitars&#39; Kauerfest 2023 on the 16th. I met some cool people and there were many nice guitars. Above all it&#39;s always very interesting to get a look inside someone&#39;s production and see how they do things. It&#39;s been really cool watching Kauer grow and gain a large following. I could see many people there were very invested in Doug&#39;s instruments and community which was very impressive and inspiring.</description>
