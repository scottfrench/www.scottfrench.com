      <description>Lots of great progress on the new SF3 body this month. Things started strong by finishing the top carving over the course of a few days. This is a spot I was a bit stuck on mentally as there are so many different ways to go about it, but in the end I think it turned out pretty well. Check out the close to final version below.

      <description>July came and went in a flash. At the start of the month I spent some time building a flexible side-dot drilling jig and toward the end of the month I started roughing out the neck heel and headstock. More photos of the progress at the instrument page below.

      <description>This journal was intended to be updated monthly, but here we are with back-to-back entries spanning two full months each. I should be back on the monthly schedule going forward. One more note before moving into the actual update... I had planned on attending the 2023 GAL Convention this upcoming week, but when I starting really looking at my current progress and funds, I decided it would be better to spend that time and money working on an actual guitar instead of going on a trip.</description>

      <description>March started slow with sickness and bad weather, then ended with even more snow. Throughout the month I continued making progress on digitizing the SF3 design into 3D for future CAD/CAM options. For now I will be doing a lot of the work on this next SF3 by hand because I don&#39;t want to waste any of this good weather on the computer. Speaking of the new SF3, there is some new progress here and at the project page below.</description>

      <description>February started with a bang and ended with a whimper. All of January&#39;s forward progress carried over to the new month with several objects being modelled and machined. I refined the pickup cover design a bit and also moved into the recessed pickup rings. From there I made some good progress on a two-piece knob design. Here&#39;s a short video showing how quick you&#39;re able to take an idea from paper to a physical object with all these awesome modern tools.</description>

      <description>January was a great month full of learning, and as a result some new progress was made on the next SF3! I&#39;ve wanted to learn 3D CAD/CAM for many years but have always been intimidated by the complexity. It was a great moment when I found out that I could do simple 2.5D CAD/CAM using Illustrator SVGs when I first got the CNC. Being able to work with software and concepts that I was already familiar with was great because it allowed me focused on the initial challenge of learning how to run a CNC and use basic CAD/CAM software.</description>

      <description>Fall is upon us and another busy time of year has come again. I missed the October website update and November is almost over! In October my family got a new Great Dane puppy named Juno. For now she&#39;s a lot of work (and puppies can be quite annoying), but we&#39;re looking forward to her being a great companion to our older Dane, Freya. Lots of family joy celebrating the new crew member and learning how to best take care of her together.</description>

      <description>Just a quick update for September. I&#39;ve added a few new backlogged journal updates with more old Boogie photos as well as a very strange Atlansia instrument. Check those out here: 1994 Atlansia Solitaire Single String Bass
Mesa Boogie Dual Rectifier Trem-o-verb Hardwood Combo
Mesa Boogie Collection Odds and Ends On the topic of the new SF3, it is moving along slowly but steadily. The plans are nearly done and I have made some solid progress in getting the new pickups all sorted and ready to start building.</description>

      <description>All things considered August was a good month on the guitar front. I started the month working on my first ever pedalboard. I have been collecting parts and planning for years but it&#39;s finally time to put it all together. Almost immediately I ran into shipping delays on some essential parts so the project is currently on hold, but I hope to finish the first version in September if there are no more delays.</description>
