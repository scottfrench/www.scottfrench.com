      <description>As I mentioned on the Inspiration page of this site, Atlansia has been one of my favorite builders for a long time. These instruments so rarely show up in the US that I didn&#39;t think long when I saw this one pop up for sale in Japan with US shipping as an option. Even with slow COVID shipping from Japan it was still worth it. I ordered it mostly to check out all the interesting features so I will likely move it along somewhat soon.</description>

      <description>I picked this up recently after about 20 years of wanting one. It&#39;s absolutely the nicest acoustic bass guitar I have played... but after owning it for a few weeks I think it is actually a little too nice for me. Oddly enough after so long waiting I lucked into a good deal on an another one of these (AB-1) that needs some work. I am going to let this one go and keep the one that needs some work as I am more of a tweaker.</description>

      <title>1990 Boire Warwick Dolphin Pro I Bass</title>

      <description>This is a no-compromise early Warwick Dolphin Pro I with all the best features. Being a 1990 it&#39;s still in the Warwick &#34;handmade&#34; era. It has the coveted Boire Rosewood body instead of the later Ovangkol. Bartolini J+MM Pickups and 2-Band Pre-amp instead of later MEC. Satin Chrome (also called titanium or platinum) hardware including Schaller strap locks. 7-piece Wenge/Zebrano neck WITHOUT the volute like the later Dolphins. No modifications, missing pieces, or weird custom features.</description>
