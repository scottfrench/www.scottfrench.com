      <description>I picked this up recently after about 20 years of wanting one. It&#39;s absolutely the nicest acoustic bass guitar I have played... but after owning it for a few weeks I think it is actually a little too nice for me. Oddly enough after so long waiting I lucked into a good deal on an another one of these (AB-1) that needs some work. I am going to let this one go and keep the one that needs some work as I am more of a tweaker.</description>

      <description>This is a pretty special Mesa Boogie Mark I. It is an original Mark I, serial A802, and was made in late 1976. Just two amps before Keith Richard&#39;s legendary A804! This was originally a 100/60w amp, then factory upgraded to Simul-class in the mid eighties (transformer code is 1985). This upgrade work was confirmed to be factory performed when the amp was sent back to Mesa for a full service and cap job in April 2018.</description>

      <description>This is a Mesa Boogie Mark IIB Coliseum, also known as the &#34;Series 300&#34;. It&#39;s a KG which mean switchable Coliseum 180-watt power section (K) and Graphic EQ (G) options are present. The speaker is an Electro-Voice EVM-15L. The included power tubes are very hard to find STR-415s as would have been included back in the 80s. Serial is K238. This amp was originally housed in a black bronco headshell, but was recently moved into this original Mesa Padauk hardwood &#34;</description>

      <title>1994 Mesa Boogie Imbuia &amp; Wicker Half-Back Speaker Cab</title>

      <description>This is a beautiful hardwood &amp; wicker speaker cabinet from Mesa Engineering. It&#39;s a half-back with an EVM-12L from 1994. Between the year and the logo plate this looks like something that would have been bundled with a Mark IV. I can see from inside that at some point a speaker was rear mounted in this cab. Based on the foam left behind I would guess it was a C90. Around this time an EVM-12L would have the black sticker so this may be an older non-original speaker.</description>

      <description>This is a no-compromise early Warwick Dolphin Pro I with all the best features. Being a 1990 it&#39;s still in the Warwick &#34;handmade&#34; era. It has the coveted Boire Rosewood body instead of the later Ovangkol. Bartolini J+MM Pickups and 2-Band Pre-amp instead of later MEC. Satin Chrome (also called titanium or platinum) hardware including Schaller strap locks. 7-piece Wenge/Zebrano neck WITHOUT the volute like the later Dolphins. No modifications, missing pieces, or weird custom features.</description>

      <title>Mesa Boogie Imbuia Hardwood &amp; Wicker Thiele Ported Compact Cab</title>

      <description>This is the Holy Grail of Mesa cabs, a vintage hardwood &amp; wicker Thiele compact cab with the original EVM-12L. This one is in Imbuia and the figure is gorgeous. Judging from the logo plate and jack style I would guess this is from the mid to late eighties. The condition is solid, but a little rough around the edges. Someone definitely loved this cab and got a lot of use out of it.</description>

      <title>Mesa Boogie Mark IIC&#43; Simul-Class, GEQ, Hardwood Medium Head</title>

      <description>This is a holy grail kind of amp on multiple fronts. IIC+/Simul-Class/GEQ is the most desired vintage Boogie by far, and for the hardwood fans these medium head shells in hardwood/wicker are almost never to be found, and the 415/416 power tube combo is the best for vintage Simul-Class Boogies. STR-415s are not common, but STR-416s have become VERY rare. On top of that, we have all the original paperwork. The tubes are tested and matching.</description>

      <description>This Mesa Boogie Lone Star Special features a fairly uncommon Tasmanian Blackwood hardwood combo cabinet.
Lots of tonal options and the great MC-90 speaker. Another one that got away but you can&#39;t keep them all.</description>

      <description>Mesa Boogie Mark III Red Stripe Head, Simul-Class, GEQ, IIC+/III+ Upgrade, All Mods, Hardwood/Wicker This is a 1987 Mesa Boogie Mark III Head. It&#39;s a Red Stripe version. It&#39;s fully loaded with Graphic EQ, Reverb, and Simul-class. It&#39;s also fully loaded in that it has the IIC+/III+ Upgrade, Reverb Fix, R2 Volume Mod, and a Triode/Pentode switch which you don&#39;t often see on these. That is just about every feature you can expect to find on a Mark III.</description>

      <description>This is a beautiful 1981 Mesa Boogie Mark IIB combo. As far as I know/understand this amp is in completetly original.
It is in very nice condition, especially when you consider it is 35
years old. I contacted Mesa Boogie support and they think this cabinet is made from imbuya. That seems to be par for the
course for this era, but this certainly has more contrast in the grain than a lot of others I have seen listed as</description>

      <description>This is the Holy Grail of Mesa cabs, a vintage hardwood &amp;amp; wicker Thiele with original EVM-12L from 1986. When you
consider this thing is around 30 years old it is in great shape. It was made using amazing 13&#34; wide padauk boards. The
condition is pretty good, but all the patina is also perfect to match a Mark head or combo from the era. I have
been looking for one of these for quite a while and was lucky enough to find an original matching pair.</description>

      <title>1993 Imbuia Hardwood &amp; Wicker Mesa Boogie Mark IV Compact Combo</title>

      <description>Here is a beautiful Mark IV from 1993. This is the &#34;A&#34; version which can be distinguished by the attached power cord and lack of foot switchable reverb.
The upside to the &#34;A&#34; version amps is the lead
channel voicing is closer to the original IIC+. This is a imbuia wood cabinet with wicker grill and it is the &#34;compact&#34;
cab size. The great looks and small size makes for a perfect living room combo.</description>
