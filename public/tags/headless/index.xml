      <description>I don&#39;t have any stats to back this up, but I am fairly certain this was my most popular
guitar. I still get random emails from people looking to pick one up. I&#39;m really happy with
the design and how the guitar turned out, but the Steinberger tuners are a little wonky so I was 
always considering different options for future travel guitars.</description>

      <description>This was a fun project with a lot of elements I had never worked with before. The active pickups and Roland synth setup were interesting and the headless hardware worked out well. This did inspire me to want to work on a more elegant headless setup as the hardware was a bit industrial in design and feel. All the black parts and the heavy headless hardware definitely gave this one a unique feel within my body of work.</description>
