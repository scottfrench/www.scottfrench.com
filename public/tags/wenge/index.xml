      <description>This is a no-compromise early Warwick Dolphin Pro I with all the best features. Being a 1990 it&#39;s still in the Warwick &#34;handmade&#34; era. It has the coveted Boire Rosewood body instead of the later Ovangkol. Bartolini J+MM Pickups and 2-Band Pre-amp instead of later MEC. Satin Chrome (also called titanium or platinum) hardware including Schaller strap locks. 7-piece Wenge/Zebrano neck WITHOUT the volute like the later Dolphins. No modifications, missing pieces, or weird custom features.</description>

      <description>This was the rare instrument I actuatlly built on spec and the whole thing just went quick and easy.
I lucked into this beautiful and THICK Claro Walnut body blank that just perfectly fit with this 
singlecut SF3 bodystyle. I already had all the hardware and electronics around so this project came together
in a matter of days. It ended up going to local person with some interesting stories and a great instrument</description>

      <description>There was a time when it was very hard to find to find wenge locally so I generally grabbed
it whenever it did show up. With that spirit one day I visited my most local, small town lumber
store and found some HUGE wenge slabs with plenty of space for multiple one-piece tops. I bought
all the clean boards and have been using them ever since. For me this guitar really was all</description>

      <description>This was an instrument with a lot of experimental elements. One of the first polyester finishes, first time
mixing body wood, first time using magnets with the control cover, and first experience with the SD Invaders!
Many firsts, but few things I even returned to.</description>

      <description>This is the first instrument I built when I moved home to California. I setup most of my tools
while I was building this one so there are some rough edges, but it turned out pretty nice and
has been used plenty live and in the studio.</description>
