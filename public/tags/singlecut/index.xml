      <description>My friend Ian called one day and let me know our local Salvation Army had an absolute unit of a buckeye burl table come in that week.
I dropped everything to go look and it ended up being several burls combined into one table using about 40 pounds of epoxy and fiberglass.
We ruined a chainsaw blade and bandsaw blade just getting this one blank out of the table, but it was well worth it.</description>

      <description>This was the rare instrument I actuatlly built on spec and the whole thing just went quick and easy.
I lucked into this beautiful and THICK Claro Walnut body blank that just perfectly fit with this 
singlecut SF3 bodystyle. I already had all the hardware and electronics around so this project came together
in a matter of days. It ended up going to local person with some interesting stories and a great instrument</description>

      <title>Headless SF3 Singlecut Synth Guitar</title>

      <description>This was a fun project with a lot of elements I had never worked with before. The active pickups and Roland synth setup were interesting and the headless hardware worked out well. This did inspire me to want to work on a more elegant headless setup as the hardware was a bit industrial in design and feel. All the black parts and the heavy headless hardware definitely gave this one a unique feel within my body of work.</description>

      <description>This bass was pretty important in the evolution of my designs as it was the first neck to utilize the
overlapping headcap with individual string guides. From here I moved onto a differnt design using solid
metal rivets instead of delrin rods, but this was still an important step. Some really nice local woods
again here.</description>

      <description>Spencer and I started talking about this guitar while I was still in Boston working at First Act.
We were hoping to get something going with their Studio for Artists program but it never panned out.
There&#39;s obviously a lot going on here... I think we hit some of the bullet points pretty well and others
lagged behind a bit. I know the stereo panning ability made it in to an album or two which is always</description>

      <description>This is the first instrument I built when I moved home to California. I setup most of my tools
while I was building this one so there are some rough edges, but it turned out pretty nice and
has been used plenty live and in the studio.</description>
