      <description>September brought along some interesting new things. I made the first two versions of this combination recessed side jack. The idea here is that this is overly thick, so when it gets recessed into the side of the guitar there should be enough material proud of the edge that it can be machined down to match the curve of the body and still have everything tucked up inside. These versions are a little bigger than they need to be so I&#39;ll have to make some updates.</description>
