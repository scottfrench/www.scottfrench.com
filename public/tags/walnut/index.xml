      <description>If you&#39;ve dug through the archived journal entries here or seen my Instagram feed you know that I&#39;ve owned a lot of Mesa Boogie amps and cabs. I love the way they sound and love that they are made in California, but I always ran into two problems. One, they are universally very heavy amps. That&#39;s not a terrible thing if you want something really well made and road worthy, but my gear doesn&#39;t move around too much.</description>
