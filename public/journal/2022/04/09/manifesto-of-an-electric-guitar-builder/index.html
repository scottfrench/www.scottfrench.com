<p class="g-0">
   There's a <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/" target="_blank">famous document</a> in the software world that
   was authored and co-signed by many of the most influential developers in the country. It outlines what they
   believe are the most important elements when starting a new project. The thing I like about this document
   is the way in which they evaluate each point using comparison. Every line contains an item on the left and an
   item on the right. They consider the items on the left to be the more important focus, but make it clear that
   items on the right are still valuable.
</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
   <p class="pink light-quote"><em>"That is, while there is value in the items on
      the right, we value the items on the left more."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="g-0">
   I like this approach so I've used something similar here to outline the core elements that I value when
   designing and building my instruments. This isn't something I believe should be applied to all instruments,
   it's just how I go about things.

<h5 id="progression" class="mt-3 g-0 pink">Progression <span class="text-lowercase">over</span> Nostalgia</h5>
<hr class="my-1 w-100" />
<p class="g-0">
   There's no getting around it: guitar building and guitar buying and guitar playing are all endeavors often driven
   by nostalgia. Even cutting edge luthiers sometimes go to extreme high-tech measures only to reproduce the sounds
   of yesteryear. I myself have many instruments I still
   <a href="/journal/2018/05/09/boire-warwick-dolphin-pro-1-bass/">obsess over</a> from
   <a href="/journal/2019/09/22/1999-taylor-klein-ab-2-imbuia-acoustic-bass/">my youth</a>. I can't
   <a href="/tags/mesaboogie/">afford them all</a>, but watch me try. 
</p>
<p class="g-0">
   As a guitar player and fan I think it's important to look back at the music and instruments that have inspired
   us. But as a guitar builder I have to think about those pioneers in lutherie and know that even in those classic
   instruments they were always pushing forward, either with new and original designs or experimenting with materials
   and construction techniques. I'm striving to push my own boundaries, continue learning new techniques, and
   always expand my influences. Looking back is fine, but the real goal is to push my work forward.
</p>

<h5 id="design" class="mt-3 g-0 pink">Design <span class="text-lowercase">over</span> Materials</h5>
<hr class="my-1 w-100" />
<p class="g-0">
   For me all the most interesting parts of an instrument start with the design. The collection of various
   elements and how they all work together to make something special is key. Material selection is important
   as well, but a quality design should be recognizable and cohesive regardless of the materials being used. 
   In my eyes a lackluster design cannot be saved by fancy materials. Often times super fancy wood can even
   distract from a design by overpowering things visually. There are times when a really beautiful piece of wood
   can elevate an instrument from good to great, but far too often I see instruments that are quite mundane being
   slathered in figured maple and abalone. This is just adding to the problem in my opinion as powerful materials
   can highlight weak design instead of elevating it. There's nothing I love more than seeing a beautiful design
   executed with interesting materials in a thoughtful way. There are also times where 
   <a href="/instruments/beardburst-green-sf0-singlecut-guitar/">beard hair and neon green paint</a>
   are the most appropriate choices.
</p>

<h5 id="simplicity" class="mt-3 g-0 pink">Materials <span class="text-lowercase">over</span> Ornamentation</h5>
<hr class="my-1 w-100" />
<p class="g-0">
   As much as I believe quality design to be the foundation of a quality instrument, I can't overstate the
   importance of selecting the proper materials to support that design. My strong preference to to choose
   simple, functionl materials and let them them stand alone in highlighting the beauty of flowing lines
   found in most of my work. I avoid decorative flourishes almost entirely as that is just my personality.
   While some of my favorite builders use inlay and other ornamentation to enhance their designs, many of
   my favorite individual instruments from those builders are the very plain versions. I was a big fan of
   PRS in the nineties, but my favorites were always the solid colors or plain mahogany bodies. I find the
   unique grain variations in a nice one-piece body more interesting than the wall-to-wall figure of a
   book-matched 10-top. I also liked moons instead of birds so go figure!
</p>

<h5 id="wood" class="mt-3 g-0 pink">Structural <span class="text-lowercase">over</span> Visual</h5>
<hr class="my-1 w-100" />
<p class="g-0">
   This is a topic of wood selection. When going to select a board for a neck I look for something that is as
   close to perfect quarter-sawn as possible. I'm not against figure in a neck, but the higher priority is very
   little runout, very straight grain, and true quartered. If a blank I have on hand happens to be very nice but
   flat-sawn, then I will often rip it and rotate to make it 2-piece and quartered. Fingerboards should also be
   quarter-sawn. I've seen flat-sawn and even figured woods being used for fingerboards, but don't think that makes
   a lot of sense when it comes time for a refret. I can understand if you are producing a lot of instruments then
   you have to take what you can to fill stock, but for a very small builder like myself I can afford to be picky.
</p>

<h5 id="response" class="mt-3 g-0 pink">Response &amp; Comfort <span class="text-lowercase">over</span> Sustain &amp; Weight</h5>
<hr class="my-1 w-100" />
<p class="g-0">
   For electric guitar bodies perfect grain is not a big concern. So instead I'm able to focus on another issue:
   weight! Two things I value in an instrument are comfort and responsiveness. For that reason
   I usually look for the lightest and most resonant boards available. For painted bodies I find basswood and poplar
   are often very light with a great tap tone. Neither are very nice to look at, but they're getting painted
   anyway. For figured woods and/or oiled bodies Claro Walnut is my favorite. It is not light weight by any stretch
   of the imagination, but that is where some aggressive chambering can help save a few pounds. Being able to use
   beautiful and local materials can sometimes mean making concessions elsewhere.
</p>

<h5 id="local" class="mt-3 g-0 pink">Local <span class="text-lowercase">over</span> Imported</h5>
<hr class="my-1 w-100" />
<p class="g-0">
   Whenever possible it's my goal to work with materials and vendors that are local to me. In some cases I'm
   able to find lumber felled and milled very nearby my house. In other cases the closest "local" vendor for a part
   might be across the country. In general I just want to keep things as local as possible. Sometimes that means just
   doing more things myself "in house" and looking to local companies to support those efforts.
</p>

<h5 id="iteration" class="mt-3 g-0 pink">Iteration <span class="text-lowercase">over</span> Tradition</h5>
<hr class="my-1 w-100" />
<p class="g-0">
   Iteration at its most simple is the concept of repeating a process over and over again. My goal with iterative
   design is to repeat the design process using slightly different criteria and feedback to evolve and improve
   my work. You can even repeat a process without any new variables and still end up with something slightly
   different and sometimes amazing... aren't brains awesome?
</p>
<p class="g-0">
   An example might be refining the body shape or a top carve over and over again when I think a lot
   of people would have stopped at "good enough". It often means making small changes that the average person doesn't
   even notice, but they certainly can feel the difference when all these small refinements are brought together. 
</p>
<p class="g-0">
   This process has become quite self-referential in my work. Iterating on a design many times, finding
   some nice details, then taking those new elements and applying them to another design and doing another round of
   iteration to find further refinements. This all means there is no "done" and each individual instrument is just
   one step in a long line of iterations.
