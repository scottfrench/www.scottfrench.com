      <description>March started slow with sickness and bad weather, then ended with even more snow. Throughout the month I continued making progress on digitizing the SF3 design into 3D for future CAD/CAM options. For now I will be doing a lot of the work on this next SF3 by hand because I don&#39;t want to waste any of this good weather on the computer. Speaking of the new SF3, there is some new progress here and at the project page below.</description>

      <description>February started with a bang and ended with a whimper. All of January&#39;s forward progress carried over to the new month with several objects being modelled and machined. I refined the pickup cover design a bit and also moved into the recessed pickup rings. From there I made some good progress on a two-piece knob design. Here&#39;s a short video showing how quick you&#39;re able to take an idea from paper to a physical object with all these awesome modern tools.</description>

      <description>January was a great month full of learning, and as a result some new progress was made on the next SF3! I&#39;ve wanted to learn 3D CAD/CAM for many years but have always been intimidated by the complexity. It was a great moment when I found out that I could do simple 2.5D CAD/CAM using Illustrator SVGs when I first got the CNC. Being able to work with software and concepts that I was already familiar with was great because it allowed me focused on the initial challenge of learning how to run a CNC and use basic CAD/CAM software.</description>

      <description>The last few months of the year are always busy around here. Holidays, birthdays, anniversaries, school events, and end-of-year work always means there is no free time. It&#39;s been a great and full year for my family so I have no complaints, but I have not been able to touch anything guitar related in some time. I&#39;m coming into the New Year with even more focus than last year, so I&#39;m excited for the coming months.</description>

      <description>Fall is upon us and another busy time of year has come again. I missed the October website update and November is almost over! In October my family got a new Great Dane puppy named Juno. For now she&#39;s a lot of work (and puppies can be quite annoying), but we&#39;re looking forward to her being a great companion to our older Dane, Freya. Lots of family joy celebrating the new crew member and learning how to best take care of her together.</description>

      <description>Just a quick update for September. I&#39;ve added a few new backlogged journal updates with more old Boogie photos as well as a very strange Atlansia instrument. Check those out here: 1994 Atlansia Solitaire Single String Bass
Mesa Boogie Dual Rectifier Trem-o-verb Hardwood Combo
Mesa Boogie Collection Odds and Ends On the topic of the new SF3, it is moving along slowly but steadily. The plans are nearly done and I have made some solid progress in getting the new pickups all sorted and ready to start building.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned on the Inspiration page of this site, Atlansia has been one of my favorite builders for a long time. These instruments so rarely show up in the US that I didn&#39;t think long when I saw this one pop up for sale in Japan with US shipping as an option. Even with slow COVID shipping from Japan it was still worth it. I ordered it mostly to check out all the interesting features so I will likely move it along somewhat soon.</description>

      <description>All things considered August was a good month on the guitar front. I started the month working on my first ever pedalboard. I have been collecting parts and planning for years but it&#39;s finally time to put it all together. Almost immediately I ran into shipping delays on some essential parts so the project is currently on hold, but I hope to finish the first version in September if there are no more delays.</description>

      <description>For anyone paying attention, you probably noticed that June came and went without an update. The reason is pretty simple, I didn&#39;t really do anything guitar related in June. School ended and my kids started their summer break. I got on a plane for the first time in fifteen years and we all took a trip to Nashville and Atlanta. We had a lot of fun there, Nashville is an interesting place and there&#39;s lots of guitar content all over.</description>

      <description>Before I launched this new site in April my hope was I would be able to to make a new journal entry each week, but during the process of getting the site finished and released I realized once per month was much more likely. April was a busy month with my wife Brianna away most of the time working a new mural. May turned out to be just as busy with several small building projects, an overnight class field trip, and lots of other family, work, and house projects.</description>

      <title>Custom Pickup for Christian Allen Luthiery</title>

      <description>Christian is a great local luthier and fellow Roberto-Venn graduate. He&#39;s been building some really interesting instruments recently and this is the third custom pickup I&#39;ve made for him. For this project he needed a magnetic humbucking pickup to cover only three closely spaced strings. This post gives you an idea of how these projects can go. I recieve some basic dimensions from Christian, then digitize those in Adobe Illustrator.</description>

      <description>Hello! Thanks for reading this. Building a new website has been a long time coming. I guess you could think of it as a more serious step in my eventual return to lutherie. I&#39;ve been away from guitar building in any productive capacity since around 2008. I have worked on some projects since then, but not a lot since 2011. Around 2018 I was in therapy working through a particularly tough time in my life, and going through that process really reawakened the desire to build instruments again.</description>

      <description>The previous entry in this four part series found me questioning some long held beliefs around the value of handmade instruments and making the decision to use all the modern tools available to me. This final entry outlines some of the other important choices that help shape my instruments. 
There&#39;s a famous document in the software world that was authored and co-signed by many of the most influential developers in the country.</description>

      <description>The previous entry in this four part series found me reconnecting with the parts of lutherie that inspired me from the start and deciding to move forward with guitar building in ways I never considered. This entry is an extension of that reconsideration of all things held holy in guitar building. 
If you went back and looked at my first website from 2004, you&#39;d see I put a lot of emphasis on my instruments being handmade.</description>

      <description>The previous entry in this four part series found me questioning my place in the guitar world and eventually leaving to pursue other endeavors. We pick up almost ten years later when my therapist encouraged me to revisit lutherie looking for some long lost seeds of joy. 
I never really stopped thinking about guitars during the time I was away, but with work and family all I really had time for in the guitar world was thinking.</description>

      <description>We&#39;re living through what is often called The Golden Age of Lutherie. Whereas in the past luthiers and large companies tended to guard their secrets, we&#39;ve seen an explosion of communication and information sharing that&#39;s raised the standard for modern instrument building. There are so many quality instruments being offered by so many great builders (both large and small) that the options are really overwhelming. Beyond all the familiar big names and the many popular smaller builders, the quality of instruments coming out of the East has been on the rise for the past 30 years as well.</description>

      <description>If you&#39;ve dug through the archived journal entries here or seen my Instagram feed you know that I&#39;ve owned a lot of Mesa Boogie amps and cabs. I love the way they sound and love that they are made in California, but I always ran into two problems. One, they are universally very heavy amps. That&#39;s not a terrible thing if you want something really well made and road worthy, but my gear doesn&#39;t move around too much.</description>

      <description>This is an early Dual Rectifier in the Trem-o-verb trim. 100-watt combo with two 12&#34; Celestion Vintage 30s. The cab is a beautiful hardwood... I believe it is Imbuia but there are no markings inside. The original grill was wheat, but I had Mesa Boogie build me a new one in wicker cane a few years back. Power tubes are a matched set of vintage Sylvania GC6L6s (STR-415). This is a weird one in that I&#39;ve never seen another hardwood Trem-o-verb head or combo.</description>

      <description>This is the Holy Grail of Mesa cabs, a vintage hardwood &amp; wicker Thiele with Electro-Voice EVM-12L from 1987. When you consider this thing is over 30 years old it is in pretty nice shape. It was made using amazing 13&#34; wide imbuia boards. Condition is pretty nice overall. There are dents and dings throughout, but overall it presents pretty well. Weight is 48lbs. I&#39;ve purchased this cab twice and both times it was poorly packaged.</description>

      <description>I picked this up recently after about 20 years of wanting one. It&#39;s absolutely the nicest acoustic bass guitar I have played... but after owning it for a few weeks I think it is actually a little too nice for me. Oddly enough after so long waiting I lucked into a good deal on an another one of these (AB-1) that needs some work. I am going to let this one go and keep the one that needs some work as I am more of a tweaker.</description>

      <description>This is a pretty special Mesa Boogie Mark I. It is an original Mark I, serial A802, and was made in late 1976. Just two amps before Keith Richard&#39;s legendary A804! This was originally a 100/60w amp, then factory upgraded to Simul-class in the mid eighties (transformer code is 1985). This upgrade work was confirmed to be factory performed when the amp was sent back to Mesa for a full service and cap job in April 2018.</description>

      <description>This is a Mesa Boogie Mark IIB Coliseum, also known as the &#34;Series 300&#34;. It&#39;s a KG which mean switchable Coliseum 180-watt power section (K) and Graphic EQ (G) options are present. The speaker is an Electro-Voice EVM-15L. The included power tubes are very hard to find STR-415s as would have been included back in the 80s. Serial is K238. This amp was originally housed in a black bronco headshell, but was recently moved into this original Mesa Padauk hardwood &#34;</description>

      <description>This Blue Angel combo is a really cool and very un-Mesa like amp. I don&#39;t think they ever made and another 2x10&#34; as far as I remember and to find one in hardwood was an amazing surprise. There are no markings inside, but if I had to guess I would say it is Imbuia. The power section of this amp mixing tube types with switchable combinations is also very strange and worth looking into if you&#39;re interested in something different for Mesa Boogie.</description>

      <description>If you&#39;re looking for the best possible Mark III then you can stop here, you&#39;ve found it. This is a 1985 Mesa Boogie Mark III. It&#39;s an early no-stripe version released just after the Mark IIC+, and being a transition model they share a few common elements. The 105 power transformer and heavier faceplate are carried over from the IIC+. This is a DRG, meaning Simul-class, Reverb, and Graphic EQ options.</description>

When you consider this thing is around 30 years old it is in pretty nice shape. It was made using amazing 13&#34; wide imbuia boards. Condition is pretty nice overall. There are dents and dings throughout, and also some substantial scratches on top from amp feet. The speaker and it has a 1989 date code.</description>

      <description>This is a beautiful hardwood &amp; wicker speaker cabinet from Mesa Engineering. It&#39;s a half-back with an EVM-12L from 1994. Between the year and the logo plate this looks like something that would have been bundled with a Mark IV. I can see from inside that at some point a speaker was rear mounted in this cab. Based on the foam left behind I would guess it was a C90. Around this time an EVM-12L would have the black sticker so this may be an older non-original speaker.</description>

It took a while before I gave it a fair shot, but upon trying it out my mind started filling up with new ideas almost immediately. Very quickly it became obvious I needed a pickup winder to start working through some of these ideas. I had looked at buying winders before but they always felt fairly expensive for the limited functionality.</description>

      <description>This is a no-compromise early Warwick Dolphin Pro I with all the best features. Being a 1990 it&#39;s still in the Warwick &#34;handmade&#34; era. It has the coveted Boire Rosewood body instead of the later Ovangkol. Bartolini J+MM Pickups and 2-Band Pre-amp instead of later MEC. Satin Chrome (also called titanium or platinum) hardware including Schaller strap locks. 7-piece Wenge/Zebrano neck WITHOUT the volute like the later Dolphins. No modifications, missing pieces, or weird custom features.</description>

      <description>This is a beautiful Mesa speaker cabinet, a vintage hardwood &amp; wicker half-back with original EVM-12L from the early 80s. When you consider this thing is around 35 years old it is in almost perfect shape. It was made using amazing 11&#34; wide boards. Based on the grain and era I think this may be padauk. There are no factory markings inside the cab but based on the logo plate and jack mount it looks to be from the Mark II/IIB/IIC/IIC+ era.</description>

      <description>This is the Holy Grail of Mesa cabs, a vintage hardwood &amp; wicker Thiele compact cab with the original EVM-12L. This one is in Imbuia and the figure is gorgeous. Judging from the logo plate and jack style I would guess this is from the mid to late eighties. The condition is solid, but a little rough around the edges. Someone definitely loved this cab and got a lot of use out of it.</description>

      <title>Mesa Boogie Mark IIC&#43; Simul-Class, GEQ, Hardwood Medium Head</title>

      <description>This is a holy grail kind of amp on multiple fronts. IIC+/Simul-Class/GEQ is the most desired vintage Boogie by far, and for the hardwood fans these medium head shells in hardwood/wicker are almost never to be found, and the 415/416 power tube combo is the best for vintage Simul-Class Boogies. STR-415s are not common, but STR-416s have become VERY rare. On top of that, we have all the original paperwork. The tubes are tested and matching.</description>

      <description>This Mesa Boogie Lone Star Special features a fairly uncommon Tasmanian Blackwood hardwood combo cabinet.
Lots of tonal options and the great MC-90 speaker. Another one that got away but you can&#39;t keep them all.</description>

      <description>This is a 1985 MESA/Boogie Mark III Combo. It is a DRG model, which means Simul-Class power section, Reverb, and Graphic EQ. This is a black/no-stripe revision which is the first of the Mark IIIs. Some early black/no-stripe examples share several features with the Mark IIC+. First, this amp has the early-style etched face plate where all the lines and text are metal instead of white paint. These hold up a lot better than the painted face plates.</description>

      <description>This is a 1987 Mesa Boogie Mark III Head. It&#39;s the Red Stripe version. It&#39;s fully loaded with Graphic EQ, Reverb, and Simul-class. It&#39;s also fully loaded in that it has the IIC+/III+ Upgrade, Reverb Fix, R2 Volume Mod, and a Triode/Pentode switch which you don&#39;t often see on these. That is just about every feature you can expect to find on a Mark III. On top of that, it comes in a beautiful Hardwood and Wicker headshell.</description>

      <description>You&#39;re looking at a 1988 Mesa Boogie Mark III Blue Stripe Combo. It is a DRG, meaning Simul-class power, Reverb, and Graphic EQ. It also has an Electro-Voice EVM-12L 12&#34; speaker. The cabinet is unmarked, but it looks like other cabinets I&#39;ve had that were marked Imbuia. This is basically a fully loaded Mark III with all the preferred features. On top of all that, it already has the factory R2 volume mod and reverb fix.</description>

      <description>This is a very clean Mark IIC in its original hardwood &amp; wicker cabinet. It&#39;s a 60 watt model with reverb. The speaker is a Mesa/Celestion Black Shadow MC-90. I am not sure the wood species, but it does seem to fit in with other hardwood Mark series amps of this era. My guess would be padauk. When I purchased this amp I was told it had a recent service/cleaning including new caps and power cord.</description>

      <description>This is a 1986 Mesa Boogie Mark III Purple Stripe Combo in Imbuya and Wicker. As far as I know this amp is 100% original. Features include Graphic EQ, Reverb, and Simul-Class which would make this a DRG. Also includes the iconic Electro Voice EVM-12L speaker. Chassis mount is SUS-4. Original vinyl cover is quite worn out. Does the job but doesn&#39;t look very good. You can judge the condition for yourself based on the photos.</description>

      <description>This is a beautiful 1981 Mesa Boogie Mark IIB combo. As far as I know/understand this amp is in completetly original.
It is in very nice condition, especially when you consider it is 35
years old. I contacted Mesa Boogie support and they think this cabinet is made from imbuya. That seems to be par for the
course for this era, but this certainly has more contrast in the grain than a lot of others I have seen listed as</description>

      <description>This is the Holy Grail of Mesa cabs, a vintage hardwood &amp;amp; wicker Thiele with original EVM-12L from 1986. When you
consider this thing is around 30 years old it is in great shape. It was made using amazing 13&#34; wide padauk boards. The
condition is pretty good, but all the patina is also perfect to match a Mark head or combo from the era. I have
been looking for one of these for quite a while and was lucky enough to find an original matching pair.</description>

      <description>Here is a beautiful Mark IV from 1993. This is the &#34;A&#34; version which can be distinguished by the attached power cord and lack of foot switchable reverb.
The upside to the &#34;A&#34; version amps is the lead
channel voicing is closer to the original IIC+. This is a imbuia wood cabinet with wicker grill and it is the &#34;compact&#34;
cab size. The great looks and small size makes for a perfect living room combo.</description>
