      <title>New Website for 2022</title>

      <description>Hello! Thanks for reading this. Building a new website has been a long time coming. I guess you could think of it as a more serious step in my eventual return to lutherie. I&#39;ve been away from guitar building in any productive capacity since around 2008. I have worked on some projects since then, but not a lot since 2011. Around 2018 I was in therapy working through a particularly tough time in my life, and going through that process really reawakened the desire to build instruments again.</description>

      <description>There&#39;s a famous document in the software world that was authored and co-signed by many of the most influencial developers in the country. It outlines what they believe are the most importatnt focuses when approaching a new project. The thing I like about this document is the way in which they evalute each point using comparison. Every line contains and item on the left and an item on the right. They consider the items on the left to be the more important focus, but make it clear that items on the right are still valuable.</description>

      <title>The Handmade Question</title>

      <description>If you went back and looked at my first website from 2004, you&#39;d see I put a lot of emphasis on my instruments being handmade. The entire first run was about as handmade as you could be. I did use a lot of power tools, but very few templates of any kind. As time has gone on I see more and more value around percision, repeatability, and doing complex things in the most quick and efficient manner available at my budget.</description>

      <description>The last entry ended at a bit of a low spot with me questioning where I fit into the guitar world and not finding a satisfactory answer before I had to return to software developent to pay the bills. It&#39;s been many years so I&#39;ve had a lot of time figure it out. It was only recently that the idea was really cemented in my head by observing how other creative people found their place.</description>

      <title>The Golden Age Of Lutherie</title>

      <description>We&#39;re living through what is often called The Golden Age of Lutherie. Whereas in the past luthiers and large companies tended to guard their secrets, we&#39;ve seen an explosion of communication and information sharing that raised the standard for modern instrument building. There are so many quality instruments being offered by so many great builders (both large and small) that the options are really overwhelming. Beyond all the familiar big names and the many popular smaller builders, the quality of instruments coming out of the east has been on the rise for the past 30 years as well.</description>

      <title>1999 Taylor/Klein Imbuia AB-2 Acoustic Bass Guitar</title>

      <description>I picked this up recently after about 20 years of wanting one. It&#39;s absolutely the nicest acoustic bass guitar I have played... but after owning it for a few weeks I think it is actually a little too nice for me. Oddly enough after so long waiting I lucked into a good deal on an another one of these (AB-1) that needs some work. I am going to let this one go and keep the one that needs some work as I am more of a tweaker.</description>

      <title>1990 Boire Warwick Dolphin Pro I Bass</title>

      <guid>https://new.scottfrench.com/journal/2018/05/09/boire-warwick-dolphin-pro-1-bass/</guid>
      <description>This is a no-compromise early Warwick Dolphin Pro I with all the best features. Being a 1990 it&#39;s still in the Warwick &#34;handmade&#34; era. It has the coveted Boire Rosewood body instead of the later Ovangkol. Bartolini J+MM Pickups and 2-Band Pre-amp instead of later MEC. Satin Chrome (also called titanium or platinum) hardware including Schaller strap locks. 7-piece Wenge/Zebrano neck WITHOUT the volute like the later Dolphins. No modifications, missing pieces, or weird custom features.</description>

      <description>Mesa Boogie Mark III Red Stripe Head, Simul-Class, GEQ, IIC+/III+ Upgrade, All Mods, Hardwood/Wicker This is a 1987 Mesa Boogie Mark III Head. It&#39;s a Red Stripe version. It&#39;s fully loaded with Graphic EQ, Reverb, and Simul-class. It&#39;s also fully loaded in that it has the IIC+/III+ Upgrade, Reverb Fix, R2 Volume Mod, and a Triode/Pentode switch which you don&#39;t often see on these. That is just about every feature you can expect to find on a Mark III.</description>

      <title>1981 Imbuia Hardwood &amp; Wicker Mesa Boogie Mark IIB Combo Amp</title>

      <description>This is a beautiful 1981 Mesa Boogie Mark IIB combo. As far as I know/understand this amp is in completetly original.
It is in very nice condition, especially when you consider it is 35
years old. I contacted Mesa Boogie support and they think this cabinet is made from imbuya. That seems to be par for the
course for this era, but this certainly has more contrast in the grain than a lot of others I have seen listed as</description>

      <title>Mesa Boogie Padauk Hardwood &amp; Wicker Thiele Ported Cab Set</title>

      <description>This is the Holy Grail of Mesa cabs, a vintage hardwood &amp;amp; wicker Thiele with original EVM-12L from 1986. When you
consider this thing is around 30 years old it is in great shape. It was made using amazing 13&#34; wide padauk boards. The
condition is pretty good, but all the patina is also perfect to match a Mark head or combo from the era. I have
been looking for one of these for quite a while and was lucky enough to find an original matching pair.</description>

      <title>1993 Imbuia Hardwood &amp; Wicker Mesa Boogie Mark IV Compact Combo</title>

      <description>Here is a beautiful Mark IV from 1993. This is the &#34;A&#34; version which can be distinguished by the attached power cord and lack of foot switchable reverb.
The upside to the &#34;A&#34; version amps is the lead
channel voicing is closer to the original IIC+. This is a imbuia wood cabinet with wicker grill and it is the &#34;compact&#34;
cab size. The great looks and small size makes for a perfect living room combo.</description>
