   Hello! I'm Scott French, a guitar builder and software developer from Northern California.
   This page is just about me, if you're interested in learning about my approach to instrument
   building please check out the <a href="/philosophy">Philosophy</a> page instead.
</p>
<h5 class="mt-2 mb-1 g-0 pink">The early years</h5>
<hr class="my-1 w-100" />
<p class="g-0">
   I was born in <em>The Capital of Silicon Valley</em>, San Jose in the early 80s.
   My family later relocated to the Sierra Foothills where I still reside with my own family.
   Growing up in California in the 80s and 90s I was into movies, music, and video games like
   most kids. My dad played guitar and by sixth grade I had picked it up myself.
</p>
<p class="g-0">
   In my teens I got into high-end guitars and became obsessed with builders like
   <a href="https://www.warwickbass.com/" target="_blank">Warwick</a> and
   <a href="https://prsguitars.com/" target="_blank">Paul Reed Smith</a>.
   FYI, Warwick and PRS were different in 90s (and I was a teenager) so give me a break!
   I think everyone goes through that phase where they are intoxicated by the materials, so a fancy
   maple top or super interesting piece of African hardwood could really make the instrument. Over
   time I stated becoming more interested in builders where unique design was the focus.
   I eventually discovered builders like <a href="https://kleinsbench.com/" target="_blank">Steve Klein</a>,
   <a href="https://www.fleishmaninstruments.net/" target="_blank">Harry Fleishman</a> and
   <a href="https://atlansiaguitars.com/" target="_blank">Atlansia</a> who's work transcended normal guitars.
   Each instrument became something so beautiful and unique you could only consider them
   works of art.

<h5 class="mt-2 mb-1 g-0 pink">Beginnings in Lutherie</h5>
<hr class="my-1 w-100" />
<p class="g-0">
   I was a kid that was good with computers and ended up leaving high school early to focus on
   studying music and computer science. At 21 I had already been working full time as a web developer for a few
   years and wanted to do something different. My love for interesting instruments had only grown
   during this time, so when I learned about <a href="https://roberto-venn.com/">The Roberto-Venn School
      of Luthiery</a> it seemed like a great chance to take my interest in fancy guitars to another level.
   Going to RV ended up being one of the best decision of my life. Beyond learning
   the "tools of the trade", I also spent a lot of time focusing on design and craft which
   have guided me to this day. My time at RV was fruitful and I ended up winning one of two apprenticeship
   spots at the now defunct First Act Studio for Artists. This was another great time of growth,
   learning from pros like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/k.butlerguitars/" target="_blank">Kelly Butler</a>
   and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jancarguitar/" target="_blank">Bill Jancar</a>, two Gibson Custom
   Shop veterans who got a chance to do their own thing at First Act. I learned a lot and met some great
   people, but after more than a year away I missed my friends and family in California and was excited to
   head home.
</p>

<h5 class="mt-2 mb-1 g-0 pink">Finding my Voice</h5>
<hr class="my-1 w-100" />
<p class="g-0">
   From 2004 to 2008 I built most of the instruments you see in the <a href="/instruments/">Gallery</a>.
   This was a great time of personal growth through many failures and successes. I was able to meet
   some amazing people through instrument building and that time really shaped my life for the better.
</p>

<h5 class="mt-2 mb-1 g-0 pink">Starting a Family</h5>
<hr class="my-1 w-100" />
<p class="g-0">
   Around 2008 it become obvious that although my designs were solidifying and my
   instruments were well received, I wasn't positioned to support myself (much less a
   family) with building instruments in this way. I wanted to own a home and in Northern
   California that requires more money than I was able to make building. I shelved most of my projects
   and went back to work full-time building software. Soon after I met my future wife
   <a href="https://www.briannafrench.com/" target="_blank">Brianna French</a> and it wasn't long
   before we welcomed Roland and then Edison into the world. Throughout this time I tried to find
   ways to keep building but struggled mightily. I'm very proud of the
   <a href="/instruments/claro-walnut-sf3co-eco-guitar-prototype/">SF3co Project</a> I started,
   but there were many instruments started that were never finished. Not finishing projects became
   a recurring problem that I've dealt with for over a decade. A few runs in therapy have helped
   a lot, but I am still waiting for that breakthrough moment where I can finish a really interesting
   instrument.

<h5 class="mt-2 mb-1 g-0 pink">Hopes for the Future</h5>
<hr class="my-1 w-100" />
<p class="g-0">
   My kids are a bit older now, but being a parent is still my main focus in 2022. My work and
   home life are more stable now than ever so I have slowly taken steps toward building again. I
   purchased a CNC router, Laser, and old coil winder and have started working these new tools into
   my process. This has been very inspiring since I've always done final design work on the computer anyway.
   I also joined <a href="https://www.instagram.com/scott__french/" target="_blank">Instagram</a> which
   exposed me to a whole new generation of builders. It's also shown me that there are people out there
   that still remember my instruments and are excited to see me build again. I'm very thankful for that
   interest all these years later.
</p>
<p class="g-0">
   Going forward I am working to bring together the different parts of my life in a more integrated
   way. Being a family man as my main focus, a software developer to make a living, and a guitar
   designer/builder as my dream had really brought about a fragmented life. It often feels like there isn't
   enough time for anything. In reality I really love software development, and technology has been the one
   constant interest of my entire life. Combining technology with my interest in music and guitars is a
   natural progression. Bringing my kids into both worlds as they get older is also a goal. Ultimately I am
   looking to spend more time working on projects I care about. I'm currently working on several, including
   two software projects related to building custom pickups and custom pedalboards. I'm also continuing to
   refine my instrument designs and learn how to build more and more complex designs using these new tools.
</p>
<p class="g-0">
   I have been so blessed with support from my family, great customers, and so much interest in my work.
   I am really looking forward to getting back into building musical instruments at a more serious level
   in the future. Thanks for visiting and reading this far!
