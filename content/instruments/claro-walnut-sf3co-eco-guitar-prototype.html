I started this prototype and the potential line of instruments it represented after taking a break from lutherie.
It marked a shift in how I think about guitars and how I go about working on a project. Even though it was ultimately
not a success, I did learn a lot about doing things <span class="fw-bold">I</span> actually care about. The response to
this instrument from potential customers was very strong and the fact that I didn't build a ton of them for excited
customers really has more to do with my own personal situation starting a family and nothing to do with players'
appetite for 'alternative' instruments. I did a long write up on the
<a href="/journal/2010/11/07/sf3co-eco-friendly-electric-guitar/">SF3co Project</a> in my journal.
