This was a fun project with a lot of elements I had never worked with before. The active pickups and Roland
synth setup were interesting and the headless hardware worked out well. This did inspire me to want to work
on a <a href="/instruments/rosewood-butternut-sf3-travel-guitar/">more elegant headless setup</a>
as the hardware was a bit industrial in design and feel. All the black parts and the
heavy headless hardware definitely gave this one a unique feel within my body of work.
