My friend Ian called one day and let me know our local Salvation Army had an absolute unit of a buckeye burl table come in that week.
I dropped everything to go look and it ended up being several burls combined into one table using about 40 pounds of epoxy and fiberglass.
We ruined a chainsaw blade and bandsaw blade just getting this one blank out of the table, but it was well worth it. Visually this is probably
one of the guitars I am most proud of. The billet I ended up using was not in an optimal position, but the extra work was worth it
for this really nice bookmatch.
