It's an amazing thing when you get your first real customer. Working at the First Act Studio for Artists I had already worked on a good amount
of instruments for big names, and I was lucky enough to have some awesome musicians as friends that I had built for, but this was my first
real customer. We exchanged a few emails about the specs then one day a check showed up and I started building. This was a great first
interaction with some really nice details to execute. I feel very blessed to have had people trust me with their instrument dreams
almost immediately upon hanging my shingle. This was also one of the instruments that started my love afair with Claro Walnut.
