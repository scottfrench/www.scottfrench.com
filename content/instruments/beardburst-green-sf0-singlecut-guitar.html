Spencer and I started talking about this guitar while I was still in Boston working at First Act.
We were hoping to get something going with their Studio for Artists program but it never panned out.
There's obviously a lot going on here... I think we hit some of the bullet points pretty well and others
lagged behind a bit. I know the stereo panning ability made it in to an album or two which is always
awesome to see. Overall this is a guitar I hear a lot about which is fun!
