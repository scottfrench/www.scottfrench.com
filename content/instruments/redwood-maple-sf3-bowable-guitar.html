This SF3 came with a fairly straightforward goal: to be easy to play with a bow.
Narrowing the SF3 design and doing an exagerated top carve ended up being the easy part...
findings pickups and a bridge to accomodate that extreme radius was more challenging.
Nordstrand was able to supply some custom NDC humbuckers with super staggered magnets for the pickups.
For the bridge I used Graphtech saddles and built a very custom ebony bridge by hand.
