I could write a lot about this guitar, but ultimately I'll just say that trying to finish the burl redwood I used for the top
had me questioning my choice to ever get involved with guitar building. In the end, finish problems aside this guitar ended
up being pretty cool and sounding really good. The SF2 is a scaled down acoustic guitar design, but really it is too
traditional for me at this point and I doubt I will go any further down this path.
