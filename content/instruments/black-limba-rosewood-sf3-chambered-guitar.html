I don't generally aim for using woods that compeltely steal the show, but even with subdued blanks I feel
like that's what ended up happening here. This black limba top and rosewood neck combo just really popped and
everything came together nicely. This is a great build to highlight how material selection and more importantly
a creative cut list can really impact the outcome. My memory is this was was originally a one-piece flat-sawn
neck blank and originally a standard 2" body blank. By ripping and flipping the neck blank into a two-piece 
quarter-sawn blank then resawing the original body blank into a carveable book-matched top this build really
came to life. Finding some nicely contrasting bits for binding and head/heel caps also went a long way.
