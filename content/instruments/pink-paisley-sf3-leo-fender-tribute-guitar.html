I built this guitar as a tribute to Leo Fender. Like every gutiar builder ever I love his material choices, simple solutions,
and timeless designs. I didn't want to lean all the way into the vintage trap though so I included some crazy 18v active
pickups. If I built this one again I would do an oiled &amp; waxed bolt-on neck.
