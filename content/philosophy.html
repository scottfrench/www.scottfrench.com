   I started writing this as one big page outlining my outlook on instrument building and how I
   got here, but it grew so large and so personal that I decided to break it up into multiple
   journal entries. I'll warn you, the first two entries are more about me and my journey, but
   they help set the stage for the second two entries. If you want to get right into the details
   about instruments I'd suggest skipping to the last entry.

   In the time since I was building regularly my outlook on many topics has changed, so this serves
   as both information for anyone interested in my work, as well as a blueprint as I move forward.
