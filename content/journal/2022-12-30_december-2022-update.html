    The last few months of the year are always busy around here. Holidays, birthdays, anniversaries, school events, and 
    end-of-year work always means there is no free time. It's been a great and full year for my family so I have no
    complaints, but I have not been able to touch anything guitar related in some time. I'm coming into the New Year with
    even more focus than last year, so I'm excited for the coming months. I had three main guitar goals for 2022, and while
    I was only able to complete one of them, I did make progress on all three. I'm looking forward to taking that momentum
    into 2023. I will finish a new guitar this year, and hopefully even more than that.

    Thanks very much to everyone following along and helping push me forward. I appreciate hearing from people via email
    even though I am often not the fastest to respond. Keep your messages coming because I really love hearing from folks
    from all over the world and discussing luthiery with everyone. I wish you all a wonderful, productive, and fulfilling
    2023!

    One new thing for me this year, I plan on attending the <a href="https://luth.org/conventions/2023-convention/" target="_blank">2023
    GAL Convention</a> in Washington. It has been many years since I went to any events so I am looking forward to a long
    weekend hanging out with guitar people. Please reach out if you are planning on attending so we can connect and say
    hello.

    Here are the last of the old Boogies to be posted. There were more, but what's left either wasn't very interesting
    or didn't  get photographed for various reasons. That being said, there are also a few random
    <a href="/journal/2022/09/15/mesa-boogie-collection-odds-and-ends/">Hardwood Mesa Boogie Odds & Ends</a> that are
    pretty interesting but didn't deserve their own individual posts.

    You can view all these amps and cabs using the <a href="/tags/mesaboogie/">Mesa Boogie</a> tag. There's nothing
    more to add unless I buy another Boogie. I always have my eye out for weird hardwood stuff... a hardwood 4x10" combo
    (Blue Angel?) or "Big Brother" 15" Combo? Let me know if you have something for sale around Northern California.
