    This Blue Angel combo is a really cool and very un-Mesa like amp. I don't think they ever made
    and another 2x10" as far as I remember and to find one in hardwood was an amazing surprise. There are
    no markings inside, but if I had to guess I would say it is Imbuia. The power section of this amp 
    mixing tube types with switchable combinations is also very strange and worth looking into if you're 
    interested in something different for Mesa Boogie. This is 100% an amp I wish I would have held onto!
