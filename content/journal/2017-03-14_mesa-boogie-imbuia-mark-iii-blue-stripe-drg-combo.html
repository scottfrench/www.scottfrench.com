    You're looking at a 1988 Mesa Boogie Mark III Blue Stripe Combo. It is a DRG, meaning
    Simul-class power, Reverb, and Graphic EQ. It also has an Electro-Voice EVM-12L 12" speaker.
    The cabinet is unmarked, but it looks like other cabinets I've had that were marked Imbuia.

    This is basically a fully loaded Mark III with all the preferred features. On top of all
    that, it already has the factory R2 volume mod and reverb fix.
    The amp/chassis is very clean. The cab does show some wear, but considering its age it is
    still in beautiful shape. Very dark wood, but gorgeous figure hidden in there.
