    February started with a bang and ended with a whimper. All of January's forward progress 
    carried over to the new month with several objects being modelled and machined. I refined the
    pickup cover design a bit and also moved into the recessed pickup rings. From there I made some
    good progress on a two-piece knob design. Here's a short video showing how quick you're able
    to take an idea from paper to a physical object with all these awesome modern tools.

    Somewhere in all that I even started on the SF3 body design. So far I haven't been happy with
    any of the results, but it is cool to at least see the rough shape in 3D space. One sticking
    point on this project is I have a lot of these old SF3co Claro Walnut body blanks that I really
    want to use, but because of the tight nature of the raw boards I extracted these from I was forced
    to rough cut out the shapes right away. That makes work holding and indexing on the CNC a lot more
    effort, so I have been trying to learn how to approach all that with some new side/toe clamps. I
    also grabbed a new surfacing bit so I can easily flatten large areas of the body more quickly.
    I'm looking forward to trying these out soon!

    A few weeks into February I started feeling pretty run down. I continued pressing on, but with
    work and family obligations I had to take a break on burning the midnight oil on guitar projects.
    Maybe I was pushing a bit hard through early February, but really I think this tiredness had more
    to do with my kids bringing home bugs from school. Edison our youngest was very sick during this
    time and eventually it caught up with Roland. I thought I might avoid getting sick since I was doing
    my best to rest, but toward the end of the month it got me too and I went down hard.

    Just as I went down a big winter storm rolled in. I've been in bed fighting a fever and coughing my
    guts out while the snow slowly accumulates outside. So that's where we end the month, just starting
    to feel a bit better while we're on day two of waiting for the power company to turn our electricity
    back on! Wish us luck, and I hope to be back next month with a more productive update.

    I made a mid-month update to the website earlier in February to allow for
    double columns of images throughout the Journal section. I think this helps a lot when there's a bunch
    of images and you had to scroll so far down to see them all. This also helps balance the page content
    with the images and differentiates the "thumbnail" and full sized "lightbox" images a bit more. And last
    but not last, Juno turned six month old this month. She's getting huge, just as you'd expect.
