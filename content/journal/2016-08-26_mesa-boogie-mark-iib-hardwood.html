 This is a beautiful 1981 Mesa Boogie Mark IIB combo. As far as I know/understand this amp is in completetly original.
It is in very nice condition, especially when you consider it is 35
years old. I contacted Mesa Boogie support and they think this cabinet is made from imbuya. That seems to be par for the
course for this era, but this certainly has more contrast in the grain than a lot of others I have seen listed as
imbuya. This is a 100/60 model with reverb and graphic EQ. Comes with original/period correct JBL E120. Very nice all
around, everything works. I played with it for about 45 minutes the other night, and the only bad thing I can say is the
cooling fan is a little noisy. If you're playing at any kind of volume that isn't an issue. I've seen the same thing
with other Mark series amps in the past. I think it is just how it goes with these.
