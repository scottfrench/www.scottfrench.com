    March started slow with sickness and bad weather, then ended with even more snow. Throughout the
    month I continued making progress on digitizing the SF3 design into 3D for future
    CAD/CAM options. For now I will be doing a lot of the work on this next SF3 by hand because
    I don't want to waste any of this good weather on the computer. Speaking of the new SF3, there
    is some new progress here and at the project page below. Just look at that one-piece claro walnut
    top!

   By the end of the month I got the new pickup ring prototypes made so now we're able to see the
   rings and top plates together. This should work nicely for the carve tops I have coming up.

   So if the theme of March was cold weather and computer work, the theme so far for April has
   been WOOD. I built a pair of basses using boire almost 20 years ago, and since then I've tried
   on and off to find more boire without any luck. I had given up a few times, but on a whim I
   decided to give it another shot recently and found some wide boards available online. They look
   awesome so I am stoked to use this stuff soon. I guess that find must have awakened the wood
   hound in me because from there I started looking for more wood locally. I stumbled into a small
   stash of walnut in my area and grabbed some really nice pieces. I ended up deciding to use one of
   the nicer ones on this new SF3. All this new wood also inspired me to dig out and surface some
   imbuia I found a while back. I've got some nice stuff stashed away for future use now.

    I probably won't have another update until later in May, but by then I hope to have some good
    progress to share on the new SF3. The nice weather is really inspiring and I am so glad I had
    been lining things up so I was ready to start right away when the warmth came. One last note
    for this update, I turn 42 in a few days... another trip around the sun!
