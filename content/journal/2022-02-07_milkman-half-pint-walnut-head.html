    If you've dug through the archived journal entries here or seen my
    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/scott__french/" target="_blank">Instagram feed</a> you know that I've
    owned a lot of Mesa Boogie amps and cabs. I love the way they sound and love that they are made in California,
    but I always ran into two problems. One, they are universally very heavy amps. That's not a terrible thing if
    you want something really well made and road worthy, but my gear doesn't move around too much. And two, even with
    Simul-class down to 15w, the Mark Series amps are still so LOUD. That's a great thing if you are playing out, but
    for a bedroom player like myself it's tough to even get into the <em>Tone-Zone&trade;</em> without blowing out
    the windows. As a result I've sold off pretty much all my Boogie gear. Just in time with Gibson getting involded.
    That left a hole that needed to be filled with something new.

    Enter <a href="https://milkmansound.com" target="_blank">Milkman Sound</a> in San Fransico. I don't know that I am
    100% onboard with the totally vintage inspired vibe, but these amps are very well made, and even better made here
    in California. When I stumbled upon this used 5W Half Pint head on Reverb and saw they they also come in WALNUT I
    didn't think twice before ordering it on the spot. Soon after I paired it with a Mather Amp 15" open back cab and
    installed an old Electro-Voice EVM-15L that I pulled out of a Boogie combo years before. It was only after purchasing
    that I realized this amp comes with a variable power attenuator built-in. That's awesome! This has been a great low
    power head so I am stoked to have found it.
