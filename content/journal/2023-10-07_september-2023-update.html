    September brought along some interesting new things. I made the first two versions of this combination
    recessed side jack. The idea here is that this is overly thick, so when it gets recessed into the side
    of the guitar there should be enough material proud of the edge that it can be machined down to match
    the curve of the body and still have everything tucked up inside. These versions are a little bigger
    than they need to be so I'll have to make some updates. I did decide I want to go with the scalloped
    side walls instead of straight walls so the last photo here is closer to what the final version
    will be.

    Next up on this project will be designing a jig so I can route a recess into the body's edge for
    this piece to slide into.
