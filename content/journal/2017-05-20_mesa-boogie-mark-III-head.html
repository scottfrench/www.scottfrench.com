    Mesa Boogie Mark III Red Stripe Head, Simul-Class, GEQ, IIC+/III+ Upgrade, All Mods, Hardwood/Wicker This is a 1987 Mesa
    Boogie Mark III Head. It's a Red Stripe version. It's fully loaded with Graphic EQ, Reverb, and Simul-class. It's also
    fully loaded in that it has the IIC+/III+ Upgrade, Reverb Fix, R2 Volume Mod, and a Triode/Pentode switch which you
    don't often see on these. That is just about every feature you can expect to find on a Mark III. On top of that, it
    comes in a beautiful Hardwood and Wicker headshell. On top of THAT, it has a full set of Winged "C" power tubes. There
    is not much else to look for. If you want the best Mark III available this is probably the one.&nbsp;Even though I do
    not have the original documentation, I was able to confirm with Mesa directly that they did all the modifications to
    this amp.

    I have an original Lead/Rhythm foot switch, but also made my own R2/Lead/EQ/Reverb foot switch in a nice metal box
    with Mesa logo. You can chose which one you'd like.

    The condition is pretty good for a 30 year old amp. I tried
    to take a lot of photos which should tell the story better than I could in words. I searched a long time for one like
    this and am only selling because I have another Mark III very similar to this in a combo now.
