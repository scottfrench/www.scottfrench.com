<p class="g-0">
    This is a 1987 Mesa
    Boogie Mark III Head. It's the Red Stripe version. It's fully loaded with Graphic EQ, Reverb, and Simul-class. It's also
    fully loaded in that it has the IIC+/III+ Upgrade, Reverb Fix, R2 Volume Mod, and a Triode/Pentode switch which you
    don't often see on these. That is just about every feature you can expect to find on a Mark III. On top of that, it
    comes in a beautiful Hardwood and Wicker headshell. On top of THAT, it has a full set of Winged "C" power tubes. There
    is not much else to look for. Even though I do
    not have the original documentation, I was able to confirm with Mesa directly that they did all the modifications to
    this amp.
