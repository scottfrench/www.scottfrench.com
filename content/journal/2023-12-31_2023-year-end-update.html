    In October I lost the thread on my guitar projects. In September school really starts getting going for my kids.
    In early October we have my son's birthday, then my wife's birthday. Then a family camping trip, then Halloween,
    Thanksgiving, colder weather, and a big, slow, frustrating project at work. Then weeks of holiday prep, family
    Christmas, and finally the New Year. I lost the thread! It's happened around late fall many times in past years,
    but it was a especially frustrating this time because in 2023 I had been making very stead progress.
</p>
<p class="g-0">
    So now I am slowly getting my head back into things and making plans for 2024. I have a lot of goals and projects
    outside of guitar building that will likely slow things down for the next few months, but I will be transitioning
    my brain back over to guitar stuff eventually. I've spent a lot of time in 2023 working toward understanding my
    core values and trying to more align my daily life with those values. That's all positive stuff, but it does
    mean that at times even things I really care about like making progress on my guitar projects still don't
    make the cut when allocating time. I fear may it be March before I make much progress there, but hopefully it will
    align with some nice weather anyway.
</p>
<p class="g-0">
    Looking back at 2023, I really did make some good progress up until fall so I am happy about that. Hopefully I can
    wring some good progress out of 2024 as well, and maybe even finish my first instrument in years. I'm looking forward
    to that and many other projects this year. I hope you had a great 2023 and wish you a happy and productive 2024!
</p>

    One last thing for the year... I've found myself mostly away from social media for the last few months and not
    really  missing it. So although it will be slow coming, I do intend on keeping the website up to date every month
    as possible. Social media not so much, so I wouldn't expect to see much on Instagram going forward. Until I actually
    finish a guitar I then all bets are off!

    It feels like about two weeks ago I was looking at my playlists and picking out the most played songs of 2022,
    but alas it was twelve months ago. Here are some top picks from 2023.
