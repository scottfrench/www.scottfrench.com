    This is the Holy Grail of Mesa cabs, a vintage hardwood & wicker Thiele with Electro-Voice EVM-12L from 1987. When
    you consider this thing is over 30 years old it is in pretty nice shape. It was made using amazing 13" wide imbuia
    boards. Condition is pretty nice overall. There are dents and dings throughout, but overall it presents pretty well.
    Weight is 48lbs.

    I've purchased this cab twice and both times it was poorly packaged. Both times the grill and baffle was damaged during
    shipping. Both times I fixed the damage before passing it along.
