    July came and went in a flash. At the start of the month I spent some time building a flexible
    side-dot drilling jig and toward the end of the month I started roughing out the neck heel and
    headstock. More photos of the progress at the instrument page below.

    The side-dot jig is pretty simple... it's a carrier to mount the fingerboard and hold replaceable
    acrylic templates for different scale lengths. The acrylic templates are made on the laser and go
    pretty quick. The results were decent, but I would like to give it another go using real drill guides
    instead of the aluminum tube stock I had on hand. Overall it was a good experience as I am trying to
    streamline the process as much as possible for future instruments.

    More recently I started roughing in the heel and headstock transitions. This is going well but I still
    need to clean up a few areas. It's been a long time since I went through this process and I am actually
    surprised how well it's coming together, but I do want to get the carve a little smoother before calling
    it done. This heel is something I really wanted to get done on the CNC, but I don't think it would have
    turned out this well. Not that the CNC isn't capable, I just don't have those CAD skills yet.

    I'm looking forward to doing some work on the body next, including cleaning up the top carve and figuring
    out how I want to handle the area around the neck-to-body transition.
