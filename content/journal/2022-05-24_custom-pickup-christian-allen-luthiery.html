    Christian is a great local luthier and fellow <a href="https://roberto-venn.com" target="_blank">Roberto-Venn</a>
    graduate. He's been building some really interesting instruments recently and this is the third custom
    pickup I've made for him. For this project he needed a magnetic humbucking pickup to cover only three closely
    spaced strings.

     This post gives you an idea of how these projects can go. I recieve some basic dimensions from Christian,
     then digitize those in Adobe Illustrator. From there I can export to SVG for use in a really simple laser
     using K40 Whisperer. In this case we used Alnico 8 Rod Magnets for a little extra output as well as some
     threaded inserts to make for a really solid pickup. From there we go to Coilton the Accuwinder with some 42
     gauge wire. We went with about 8500 winds per coil for a total series output of about 6k ohms. Next is wax
     potting on the double boiler and then coil tape and assembly. The final product is a compact and solid
     pickup that should work well with the other elements being used on Christian's latest project.
