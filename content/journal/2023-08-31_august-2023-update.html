    Lots of great progress on the new SF3 body this month. Things started strong by finishing the top
    carving over the course of a few days. This is a spot I was a bit stuck on mentally as there are so
    many different ways to go about it, but in the end I think it turned out pretty well. Check out the
    close to final version below.

     Next up I finished out the month by completing the top routing for the neck, pickups, and controls.
     This was a big step that I have been thinking about for a long time so there was a lot of build up
     and planning. The work was a bit sparse, but most of the month was spent doing test jobs and
     calculations. Once that was all in place I ended up spending a full day just running and adjusting
     the jobs. I'm very thankful it all came together pretty well!

     I'm very proud of my past work, but at a technical/craft level this is all looking so much
     cleaner and tighter than anything I've made in the past. It is really tough trying to fit all this
     new work in with my family life and day job, but the added bonus is that I've been able to consider
     and refine these ideas quite a bit over a long period of time. I'm very excited for how this thing
     is starting to feel!
