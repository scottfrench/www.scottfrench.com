Here is a beautiful Mark IV from 1993. This is the "A" version which can be distinguished by the attached power cord and lack of foot switchable reverb.
The upside to the "A" version amps is the lead
channel voicing is closer to the original IIC+. This is a imbuia wood cabinet with wicker grill and it is the "compact"
cab size. The great looks and small size makes for a perfect living room combo. Don't take that to mean it isn't a great
sounding amp as well, it's amazing. It also has the volume to gig with no problem. This Mark IV originally came with an
Electro-Voice EVM12L which I found to be pretty sterile in the open back combo. I replaced it with a "vintage" Black
Shadow Celestion MC-90. The Celestion meets the wattage requirements but has much more guitar character than the
EVM-12L, which is more of a sound reinforcement speaker. I recently went through the amp, cleaned it, replaced the
reverb
tank with an OEM Mesa model, and replaced the
speaker. It is ready to rock. This amp really has it all in a tiny package... tone for days, tons of flexibility and lots
of power.
