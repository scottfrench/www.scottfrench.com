    This is the Holy Grail of Mesa cabs, a vintage hardwood & wicker Thiele compact cab with the original EVM-12L. This one
    is in Imbuia and the figure is gorgeous. Judging from the logo plate and jack style I would guess this is from the mid
    to late eighties.

    The condition is solid, but a little rough around the edges. Someone definitely loved this cab and got a lot of use out
    of it. There are a good amount of dents and dings as shown in the photos. That all being said, you usually only see one
    or two of these go up for sale online every year, so finding one at all is a rare event.
