    This is a beautiful Mesa speaker cabinet, a vintage hardwood & wicker half-back with original EVM-12L from the early 80s.
    When you consider this thing is around 35 years old it is in almost perfect shape. It was made using amazing 11" wide
    boards. Based on the grain and era I think this may be padauk. There are no factory markings inside the cab but based on
    the logo plate and jack mount it looks to be from the Mark II/IIB/IIC/IIC+ era.
