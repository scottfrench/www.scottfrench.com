    This is a pretty special Mesa Boogie Mark I. It is an original Mark I, serial A802, and was made in late 1976. Just two
    amps before Keith Richard's legendary A804! This was originally a 100/60w amp, then factory upgraded to Simul-class in
    the mid eighties (transformer code is 1985). This upgrade work was confirmed to be factory performed when the amp was
    sent back to Mesa for a full service and cap job in April 2018. Surprisingly enough I was told this was not the only
    Mark I to be upgraded to Simul-class, but I have certainly never seen another. I'd love to hear from anyone that has
    one, or any other weird/rare Mesa gear.
</p>
<p class="g-0">
    So after the factory upgrade work, we now have a Mark I DRG combo. That
    means the switchable 75/15w power section (D), Reverb (R), and Graphic EQ (G) options are included. This is just about
    everything you could ever hope for on a Mark I unless you are outside of the US and need the export transformer option
    (not present here).
</p>
<p class="g-0">
    The power tubes are vintage STR-415 6L6s and STR-416 EL34s. Anyone that's looked knows the
    415s are hard to find, but the 416s are basically impossible. You have to get really lucky or dig like crazy (like I
    have to a silly extent).

    This amp was originally housed in a white/cream combo, but was recently upgraded to this
    late Mark I cab from 1978. The cabinet is unmarked, but based on the grain and coloring (photo shows original color
    under the handle) I am fairly certain this is a Padauk combo cab. It's clearly seen a lot of sun and the original red
    color has mellowed to this beautiful brown/orange. The speaker is an early black frame Electro-Voice EVM-12L.
</p>
<p class="g-0">
    The overall condition is
    pretty good for a 43 year old amp. The cab looks like it has seen some rough times, with the finish quality varying from
    side-to-side, but at 5+ feet it presents pretty well. The chassis itself is very clean, all the labels are intact, and
    the circuit has been recently factory serviced. Most original Mark amps this old have a lot more mileage on them and
    questionable service history.

This amp weighs 70 pounds.
