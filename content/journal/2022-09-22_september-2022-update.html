    Just a quick update for September. I've added a few new backlogged journal updates with more old Boogie
    photos as well as a very strange Atlansia instrument. Check those out here:

    On the topic of the new SF3, it is moving along slowly but steadily. The plans are nearly done and I have
    made some solid progress in getting the new pickups all sorted and ready to start building. I've selected
    the materials and purchased all the small parts required for the new pickup mounting design so that work will
    start soon.

    Still waiting on parts for the pedalboard so I have moved it off the bench. Looking forward to getting back
    into that soon. For now the new SF3 is the focus!
