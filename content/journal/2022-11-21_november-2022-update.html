    Fall is upon us and another busy time of year has come again. I missed the October website update and November
    is almost over! In October my family got a new Great Dane puppy named Juno. For now she's a lot of work (and
    puppies can be quite annoying), but we're looking forward to her being a great companion to our older Dane,
    Freya. Lots of family joy celebrating the new crew member and learning how to best take care of her together.
    It's eaten up a lot of time but has been well worth it seeing my kids fall in love with her.

    As busy as the last month has been, I know we'll be even more busy until the new year. Lots of school events and
    important family time. Because of all that not much is going to be happening on the guitar front until January. 
    Before getting Juno I did get the laser tuned up and cut the flatwork for the new SF3 project. If I can sneak
    it in I might work on building out those pickups at some point before the new year.

    This month I've added four old Mark III combos that I owned over the years. This represents almost all the stripes...
    I've never owned a green as far as I can remember, but here is one of everything else. The two early amps, the black
    stripe and "no" stripe both had the carryover 105PT that a lot of people seek out. Then there are the two more typical
    purple and blue stripes from later on. These were all beautiful amps, but the early no stripe with 105PT had just about
    every upgrade you could get from Boogie after the fact and it was really a cut above any other Mark III I've ever seen.
