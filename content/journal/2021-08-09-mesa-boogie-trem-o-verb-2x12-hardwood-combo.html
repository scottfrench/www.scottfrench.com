    This is an early Dual Rectifier in the Trem-o-verb trim. 100-watt combo with two 12" Celestion Vintage
    30s. The cab is a beautiful hardwood... I believe it is Imbuia but there are no markings inside. The original
    grill was wheat, but I had Mesa Boogie build me a new one in wicker cane a few years back. Power tubes
    are a matched set of vintage Sylvania GC6L6s (STR-415).

    This is a weird one in that I've never seen another hardwood Trem-o-verb head or combo. The 2x12" combo combined
    with hardwood cabinet made for a VERY heavy amp.
