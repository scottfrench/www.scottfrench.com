    All things considered August was a good month on the guitar front. I started the month working
    on my first ever pedalboard. I have been collecting parts and planning for years but it's
    finally time to put it all together. Almost immediately I ran into shipping delays on some
    essential parts so the project is currently on hold, but I hope to finish the first version in
    September if there are no more delays.

    Even more exciting than the pedalboard, I'm finally getting started on a new SF3 guitar in earnest.
    I have been testings ideas on the CNC and pickup winder for a while, but finally feel ready to
    take the plunge in officially starting a new guitar. It's been a long road to get here with
    many bumps along the way, but I am feeling like I've progressed enough mentally away from
    the frustration around prior failed and delayed projects to finally make a solid new start.

    It's no secret that I have started and stopped building many guitars over the last decade for various
    reasons. The frustration and shame around that repeated pattern has really prevented me from getting started
    on any serious projects for a long time. I've been working hard over the last year plus trying to understand
    these various failure points and I feel confident I will be able to push through and finish this
    project. Beyond that I have some extra support from my coach <a href="https://www.ironjohncoaching.com">David
        @ Iron John Coaching</a>. David is a really awesome guy that has already helped me understand
    and start pushing though some difficult stuff. If you're feeling stuck with anything in your
    life and feel like you could use some help I suggest reaching out to David. He specializes
    in working with men and is also a musician so I expect many of the people viewing my website fall into those
    buckets. Don't be afraid to find help if you need some, it's worth it!
