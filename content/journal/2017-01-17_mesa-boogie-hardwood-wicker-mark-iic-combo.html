    This is a very clean Mark IIC in its original hardwood & wicker cabinet. It's a 60 watt model
    with reverb. The speaker is a Mesa/Celestion Black Shadow MC-90. I am not sure the wood species,
    but it does seem to fit in with other hardwood Mark series amps of this era. My guess would be
    padauk.

    When I purchased this amp I was told it had a recent service/cleaning including new caps and power
    cord. An "OEM" Howard Industries cooling fan has also been added. I have not confirmed any of the
    service but the amp does seem to be in good shape.

    You don't see a lot of straight IICs anymore... I don't think there were ever many, and most have
    been upgraded to IIC+.
