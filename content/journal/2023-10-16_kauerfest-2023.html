    I had a fun day down at <a href="https://www.kauerguitars.com" target="_blank">Kauer Guitars</a>' Kauerfest 2023 on the 16th.
    I met some cool people and there were many nice guitars. Above all it's always very interesting to get a look
    inside someone's production and see how they do things. It's been really cool watching Kauer grow and gain a
    large following. I could see many people there were very invested in Doug's instruments and community which
    was very impressive and inspiring. It was also great to meet a few of Kauer's very talented employees. It was
    obvious how much buy-in and pride they had in working there.

    Another surprise was meeting the man behind <a href="https://chibson.com" target="_blank">Chibson USA</a>... that was a silly
    and unexpected treat. The tacos were good and I wished I had grabbed a few more on the long drive home.
