    Before I launched this new site in April my hope was I would be able to to make a new journal entry each
    week, but during the process of getting the site finished and released I realized once per month was much
    more likely. April was a busy month with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/brianna_french_art/"
    target="_blank">my wife Brianna</a> away most of the time working a new mural. May turned out to be just as
    busy with several small building projects, an overnight class field trip, and lots of other family, work, and
    house projects. So making updates throughout the month was not possible, but to make up for that I am doing this
    largish update with <a href="/tags/may-2022-update/">eight new entries</a> now.
</p>
<p class="g-0">
    The first new thing of the month was an SF3 illutration from <a href="https://daleillustration.com"
    target="_blank">Dale Cullinane</a> that I hope to get turned into some stickers soon. Let me know if you have
    any suggestions for body colors. I am considering printing on foil so the metallic hardware can shine. 
</p>
<p class="g-0">
    On a non-guitar related note, we made up some keychains to commemorate the first overnight trip
    for my son's class. These were a lot of fun to make with my son doing to design, Brianna refining and digitizing,
    then me hacking them out on the K40. I'll make another post about the laser someday because the K40 is not a bad
    tool considering the very low price.
</p>
<p class="g-0">
    Another fun thing over the last few weeks has been pulling together all my guitar stuff, books, mics, and random
    buisness to be consolidates in the office. I also brought in all the pickup making and some electronics stuff
    into a little corner work area so it doesn't have to keep getting so dirty in the woodshop (garge). I've added
    some random images of the office here.
</p>
<p class="g-0">
    Next up was a <a href="/journal/2022/05/24/custom-pickup-christian-allen-luthiery/">custom pickup
    project</a> for <a href="http://christianallenluthiery.com/" target="_blank">Christian Allen Luthiery</a>. I
    put together a journal entry with a lot of images outlining the process. That reminded me I also wanted to share
    some information about my pickup winder, so I made another entry about <a
    href="/journal/2018/11/18/accuwinder-pickup-winder/">Coilton the Accuwinder</a> coil-winding machine. I love
    this tool and feel very lucky to have found it.
</p>

    Someday I will run out of Boogies from my image archive, but that day will not be any time soon. So for
    this round I added four more amps/cabs to the archive with many detailed photos. There at still lots more to add
    in the future so keep your Boogie-loving eyes peeled. For now check out the links at the bottom of the page to see
    the new entries.
</p>
<p class="g-0">
    Going through all that Boogie content, as well as adding some random photos of the ToneShed&trade; (my office),
    reminded me I also wanted to show off the beautiful <a
    href="/journal/2022/02/07/milkman-half-pint-walnut-head-mather-cab/">Walnut &amp; Wicker Milkman 5W Half Pint</a>
    I picked up a while back. This is a sweet amp that I am super stoked about. I loved all my Boogies but this suits
    my situation much better.
</p>
<p class="g-0">
    To close out with a few more random odds and ends, my goal for this month was to knock out a hardwood and aluminium
    pedal board I have been planning on and off for years. I'm close to a final design and have all the materials ready
    so hopefully I can share that soon. On the instrument front, I have some in-depth plans for new pickups and custom
    features for a new instrument design. I'll likely be working on this instrument into 2023, but as part of these plans
    I've picked up my first 3D printer. I started with a very small resin printer so I can learn the basics, but I have
    big plans for this next instrument and 3D printing specialized parts may be a key concept.
</p>
<p class="g-0">
    Thanks for looking and stay tuned for more next month!
