<h5 class="mt-2 g-0 pink">Scott French Braille Logo</h5>
<hr class="my-1 w-100" />
<p class="g-0">The Scott French Braille logo designed by Cody Dingle is laid into the headstock face using aluminum,
   stainless steel, or brass solid rivets. The logo represents the physical connection between a musician and his
   instrument. In other words, the parts of the instrument you can feel like body weight, balance, neck carves and fret
   end treatments are very important to the Scott French philosophy.</p>
<h5 class="mt-2 g-0 pink">Scarf-Jointed / Tapered Thickness Headstock</h5>
<hr class="my-1 w-100" />
<p class="g-0">All Scott French instruments are scarf jointed in a manner that overcomes the common problem of end grain breakage at
the headstock you often see on angled back instruments. In addition to this the headstock is also slightly tapered to be
thinner at the end to help absorb some of the shock if the instrument is dropped on its neck.</p>
<h5 class="mt-2 g-0 pink">Matching Headstock and Heel</h5>
<hr class="my-1 w-100" />
<p class="g-0">Standard solid matching headstock and heel or the optional multi-laminate ones (to match neck) are offered. The headcap
and heelcap will also match as will the optional fingerboard binding if chosen.</p>
<h5 class="mt-2 g-0 pink">Individual String Guides w/Zero Fret</h5>
<hr class="my-1 w-100" />
<p class="g-0">Open notes sound the same as fretted notes with a Zero Fret. Directly mounted Individual String Guides are solidly mated
with the neck. The elements are round to match the circular theme established with the Braille logo, truss rod cover,
tuner posts, knobs, etc. They also help avoid the ugly butt joints usually used with normal bar shaped nuts.</p>
<h5 class="mt-2 g-0 pink">Multi-Laminate Neck</h5>
<hr class="my-1 w-100" />
<p class="g-0">The ability to carefully select the grain orientation for each section of the neck is a great advantage of laminated
necks. Adding a small amount of stiffer, heavier wood can strengthen the neck without adding a large amount of weight.</p>
<h5 class="mt-2 g-0 pink">Set-Neck Joint</h5>
<hr class="my-1 w-100" />
<p class="g-0">Bolt-on and thru-body neck joints both have their high and low points. Set-neck construction takes the best of both
methods and avoids many of the inherent problems of the others. Thru-body neck joints offer great sustain and smooth
heel transitions, but because the bridge is attached to the neck blank the body wings are almost completely eliminated
from the sound palate. Thru-body instruments also tend to be overly heavy with all that extra strong (heavy) neck stock
in the body. Bolt-on joints allow for the body to be part of the sound palate, but the bolting area tends to be bulky
making higher frets access difficult. Set-neck construction allows for a smooth neck joint with easy fret access while
keeping the body wood in the sound palate.</p>
<h5 class="mt-2 g-0 pink">Carved Top over a ''Tuning Fork'' style Hollow Body</h5>
<hr class="my-1 w-100" />
<p class="g-0">Each ergonomic body has a 3/4'' thick carved top and standard round over edge. Optional top binding is available to
match the fingerboard binding and/or headcap/heelcap. The 1 1/2'' thick body is hollowed to save weight and increase
response. The ''Tuning Fork'' style chambering is used to avoid feedback at high volumes. The electronics are run
through the neck pickup route to avoid an unsightly rear access control cavity cover.</p>
<h5 class="mt-2 g-0 pink">Versatile Humbucking Electronics</h5>
<hr class="my-1 w-100" />
<p class="g-0">Two dual coil pickups are used for their high output and quiet operation. A 3-way pickup selector with a
series/single/parallel switch for each pickup is standard. A 6-position rotary pickup selector is offered for cleaner
looks and easier use. 500k resistance pots are used, the volume with a .001 µF treble bypass cap and the tone using a
.043 µF cap.</p>
